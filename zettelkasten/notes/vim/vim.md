# Create a new file:
you can create new files in vim by going to the explorer mode typing :Ex and then pressing % for creating a new file or d for creating a new directory or you can type :e %:h/filename, % for current directory, :h for file modifier , to avoid 
typing %:h you can put :set autochdir so then you can just write :e filename
>
